                <title>Intro</title>Hello, my name is Appie, and while I don't think my backstory is that outlandish, I
                do believe
                it's a mix of ambition and complexity. I'm a 19-year-old who lives in Belgium, speaks five languages,
                and I have a
                deep passion for everything that involves computers. My goal is simple but bold: to become the best at
                what I do.
            </p>
            <p>
                <title>Learning and Ambitions</title>I'm not just a computer science enthusiast; I'm obsessed with
                mastering the
                low-level, high-performance stuff. Whether it's C, C++, Rust, Python, or Java, I want to break down
                every line of
                code and rebuild it better. The journey is hard, but every bug I squash and every optimization I find
                takes me one
                step closer to the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                <title>Friends</title>If I had to sum up my attitude toward friendships, it's a love-hate relationship.
                I enjoy
                spending time with friends, sharing laughs, and helping out where I can. But the truth is, I'm pretty
                demanding of
                the people I keep close. If you're in my circle, I expect you to strive as hard as I do, or I might just
                feel you're
                wasting your potential — and that annoys me more than anything else.
            </p>

                <title>Hobbies</title>Outside of coding and tech, I find joy in pushing my creativity through projects.
                Whether it's
                tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, designing a clean i3 setup, or optimizing my workflow, I love turning
                small ideas
                into functioning solutions. It's satisfying to build something from scratch and see it work seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <title>Marthe</title>One of the most meaningful parts of my life is my partner, Marthe. They have their
                own dreams
                and aspirations, and it's inspiring to watch someone pursue what they love. Whether it's math, science,
                or figuring
                out what comes next, we're two different minds finding ways to build something beautiful together.
            </p>
            <p>
                <title>Future</title>Where do I see myself? At the forefront of technology — building optimized systems,
                contributing to open-source, and pushing boundaries in programming. Whether I'm creating Minecraft
                plugins for fun
                or architecting low-latency systems, I want my work to speak for itself. The best version of me is still
                under
                construction, but I'm committed to seeing it through.
